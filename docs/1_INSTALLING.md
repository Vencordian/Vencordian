## Installing Vencord

Install `pnpm`:

> :exclamation: This next command may need to be run as admin/root depending on your system, and you may need to close and reopen your terminal for pnpm to be in your PATH.

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```

> :exclamation: **IMPORTANT** Make sure you aren't using an admin/root terminal from here onwards. It **will** mess up your Discord/Vencord instance and you **will** most likely have to reinstall.

Clone Vencord:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Vencordian/Vencordian
cd Vencordian
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Build Vencord:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Inject Vencord into your client:

```shell
pnpm inject
```

Then fully close Discord from your taskbar or task manager, and restart it. Vencord should be injected. You can check this by looking for the Vencord section in Discord settings.

## Updating Vencord

If you're using Discord already, go into the `Updater` tab in settings.

Sometimes it may be necessary to manually update if the GUI updater fails.

To pull latest changes:

```shell
git pull
```

If this fails, you likely need to reset your local changes to Vencord to resolve merge errors:

> :exclamation: This command will remove any local changes you've made to Vencord. Make sure you back up if you made any code changes you don't want to lose!

```shell
git reset --hard
git pull
```

and then to build the changes:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Then just refresh your client

## Uninstalling Vencord

Simply run:

```shell
pnpm uninject
```
