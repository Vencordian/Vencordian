        # READ THIS BEFORE OPENING A REQUEST

        **You will be blocked from opening further requests if you don't follow these rules.**
        
        Before making a request, make sure someone didn't already request the plugin to be added.

        Put the name of the plugin as the title of the request.

        Skip formalities like "hello" and do not use AI to "spice up" your request. Keep it short and concise, with only the information necessary.
        ## One request per issue

        Do not include multiple requests in one issue. If you are making 5 requests, make 5 separate issues.
        
        ## Do not request any of the following plugins:
        - Plugins that spam Discord and thus risk an account suspension. Examples:
          - Message Pruner
          - Animated Status
          - Nitro Snipers
          - Selfbots
        - Plugins that replace text in your messages, like FxTwitter. (Use https://vencord.dev/plugins/TextReplace!)
        - Plugins that hide UI elements, like the GIF button. (Use QuickCSS instead!)
